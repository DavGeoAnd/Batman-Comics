<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is David Andalcio and I'm in my first year at DePaul. I'm in the CDM program and pursuing a bacholars degree in Software Engineering.
I went to high school at Lane Tech in Chicago and took computer classes every year. This included coding languages
in Visual Basic, Java, Scratch(not really a writing language), and Android. Before this interest in computer science, comics was one of the biggest interest in my life.</p>
<p>Growing up, my brother and I have been reading comics and still take every chance we take to read more comics.
Out of all the comics I have read, DC comics has always been my favorite and by the website I made, kind of shows which hero is my favorite.
I believe that comics are a way to show problems in everyday life around the world even though they are put in over-the-top situations.
Batman, in my opinion, is the best example of this given that he has no powers and has to overcome all the problems that other heroes go through.
Also, I felt that his comics really showed the gray area in life between right and wrong and that always caught my interest.
